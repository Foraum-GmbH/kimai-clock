## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.  
Instead, report it privately:

- Email: security@foraum.de  
- Or use GitHub’s [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

We aim to respond within **72 hours**, and will provide updates as we investigate.  
If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will publish a security advisory and release a patched version as soon as possible.
